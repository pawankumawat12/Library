## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#42A5F5) for a modern and inviting feel. It represents trust and knowledge, appropriate for an educational platform.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5), close to white, to provide a clean, non-distracting backdrop.
- Accent color: Orange-red (#FF5722) for calls to action, highlights, and important alerts to draw user attention.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, provides a clean and modern look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, clear icons from a consistent set (e.g., Material Design Icons) for navigation and actions.
- Maintain a consistent and responsive layout with rounded corners, subtle shadows, and sufficient padding.
- Use smooth, subtle transitions for hover states and mode toggling to enhance user experience.
